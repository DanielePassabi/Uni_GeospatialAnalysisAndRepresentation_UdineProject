## Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

- *Static map of Udine, with universities and points of interest*

    It provides the main information about the city.
    
- *Interactive map of Udine with real walking and cycling routes*
    
    The map is designed for those who want to train and test themselves.

- *Geospatial analysis of average house prices and rents in the province of Udine*
    
    Interesting for those planning to move to Udine or its vicinity. It provides useful hints and considerations about the influence of each municipality on prices in neighbouring municipalities.
