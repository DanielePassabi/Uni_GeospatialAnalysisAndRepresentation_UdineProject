## Course

Geospatial Analysis and Representation for Data Science (2021-2022)

## Aim of the Project

The project focuses on Udine and its municipalities. It is mainly aimed at students interested in studying and moving to the city.

The notebooks are also freely explorable on this [webpage](https://danielepassabi.github.io/uni/geo/geo_project.html). The website also displays the key results obtained in a more user-friendly form.

## Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. *Static map of Udine, with universities and points of interest*

    It provides the main information about the city.
    
2. *Interactive map of Udine with real walking and cycling routes*
    
    The map is designed for those who want to train and test themselves.

3. *Geospatial analysis of average house prices and rents in the province of Udine*
    
    Interesting for those planning to move to Udine or its vicinity. It provides useful hints and considerations about the influence of each municipality on prices in neighbouring municipalities.
